## üìò Abstract

This dissertation develops new mathematical frameworks to explain the *manufacturing learning curve* ‚Äî the empirically observed process by which production performance (e.g., cost, error rate, product lifetime) improves with experience.  

Two continuous models are introduced, each grounded in first principles of **information theory** and **statistical mechanics**:

1. **Weak Convergence of Random Sets** ‚Äì introduces a new mathematical concept that generalizes convergence from individual functions or sets to *sequences of sets and random sets*.  
   - Defines a *pseudo‚Äìinner product* between sets using measure intersection.  
   - Establishes a notion of **weak convergence** analogous to weak-* convergence in functional analysis.  
   - Extends this to **random and dynamic random sets**, producing a rigorous framework for continuous learning and growth phenomena.  

2. **Partial Differential Equation (PDE) Model** ‚Äì interprets the learning process as a **transport equation** derived from a Poisson process in time, providing a continuum approximation of discrete learning events.

Both models generate the empirically observed shape of industrial learning curves, including *plateaus* and *nonlinear early-phase behavior*, without ad hoc assumptions.

## üß© Novel Contributions

- **New Mathematical Concept:** Introduced *weak convergence of random sets*, extending random set theory beyond classical (Hausdorff, Fell) topologies into a functional-analytic framework.  
- **Unified Framework:** Deterministic, random, and time-evolving (‚Äúdynamic‚Äù) random sets are all treated under a single analytic definition.  
- **Applications:** Demonstrated connections between the learning curve, information theory, entropy, and statistical mechanics.  
- **Analytical Flexibility:** The weak-limit approach provides a method to derive continuous models from discrete probabilistic systems.
